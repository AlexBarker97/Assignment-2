'abc' > 123
Comparing string '' to int() not possible

'apple' < 'banana'
True because it compares starting from the left, 'b' has a 1 higher ASCII than 'a'.

'oranges' < 'ORANGES'
False because lower case comes after upper case in ASCII, therefore O < o.

a = True
b = (5 > 7)
a == b 
If a is true, b is not true then a is not equal to b. Therefore false.

str = ""
not str 
An empty string is false, therefore the not of this is true.

string = "0"
not string
A string contains something, and is therefore true, the not of this is false.
