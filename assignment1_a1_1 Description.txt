general observations:
/ floating point division giving a float output
// floor division giving rounds down, depends on data type on what it outputs (if any float it will give float out)
** power (if any inputs are float, output will be float, otherwise it is integer)
If result is a decimal it will automatically make output a float and pring the full result.

1) 
5/2
The floating point division operator does the division creating a float value as the answer.
5/2.0
Again this gives a float value as a result.
5/2.0
Same as above
5//2
Floor divison rounds down to an integer value
5.0//2.0
Again rounds down but gives a float keeping to the decimal places on the input.

2)
7*(1/2)
Floating point division again giving a floating point.
7*(1//2.0)
Rounds down to 7, multiplied by 0 giving 0.0 float
8*1//2.0
simple float output given 8 multiplied by 1 happens before division so that it is not rounded down to zero.

3)
1/3.0
Floating point division gives a float or 0.33recurring.

4)
5**2.0 ** being a power function to the power of a float always returns a float
5.0**2.0 same result as before due to there being a float on the input
5**2 integer result output due to all values input being integers
