The duplicates list comprehension uses the pop function to remove values from list 1 and add them to the entry of
the created duplicates list. It iterates for each value in list1 checking if that value exists anywhere in list 2.
The problem is if it removes a value in the list then increasing the iteration(i) value by 1. This leads to on the
next iteration skipping the next value since they have all been shifted to the left and the i value is now not
representative of the order which it should be checking.
This could be changed to:
duplicates = [list1.pop(list1.index(i)) for i in list1[::-1] if i in list2]
The "for i in list1[::-1]" reverses the order that the comprehension iterates over, therefore if a value is removed
the i values still stand for decreasing tests.
