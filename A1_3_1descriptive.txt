1.3.1
The input: [x**2/16 - y**2/4 for x in range (0,5) for y in [4,8,12,16,20]]
This works by using x-values from 0 to 5 in steps of 1 by default for the y-values [4,8,12,16,20].
The function's BIDMAS order is quite important, it squares both x and y-values then divides them by 16 and 4 
respectively, it then subtracts the y**2/4 value from the x**2/16 value. It selects the order of values as follows.
It will run through all the x=0 values against the y=4,8,12... then increase x by the step (not defined so default 1)
so therefore move onto x=1 for y-values of 4,8,12...

for loop equivalent:
List = []
for x in range (0,5):
    for y in [4,8,12,16,20]:
        List.append(x**2/16-y**2/4)
print(List)
